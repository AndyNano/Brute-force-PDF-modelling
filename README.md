# Brute-force-PDF-modelling (Insert rest in the same format as DeepStruc)

This script provides a brute-force modelling approach to predict the Mono-Metallic Nanoparticle (MMNP) from a Pair Distribution Function (PDF).

Currently the script is limited to MMNPs with up to 200 atoms of the 7 different structure types: Cubic (sc), body-centered cubic (bcc), face-centered cubic (fcc), hexagonal closed packed (hcp), decahedral, icosahedral and octahedral.
